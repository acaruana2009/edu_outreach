- [x] Explanation of parameter uncertainty determination
- [x] How to use roughnesses **properly**
- [x] Roughness implementation
- [ ] Sensitivity limits (e.g. if film is 99% hydrated you might not see it?)
- [ ] Resolution
- [ ] Perhaps discussion of differential evolution is not necessary


Some comments from @timsnow

- [ ] After eqn. 3 - is nuclear scattering length density or neutron SLD a more common turn of phrase? (You use SLD in figure 1's caption text, for example)
- [x] Figure 1's caption could do with clarifying to highlight that all three plots are representations of different aspects of the kinematic approach
- [x] Below eqn 5, remove exclamation mark in the body text, it's oddly out of place; yes it's impossible but it's not like the world ended
- [ ] Whilst potentially beyond the scope of the article (but maybe only just) is it worth mentioning something about contrast measurements and co-refinement in global optimisation?
- [ ] Does Jos have a paper on the Bayesian / ML work they've been conducting? (For the end of section 4)
