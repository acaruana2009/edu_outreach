Some comments from @andyfaff

- [x] Explanation of parameter uncertainty determination
- [x] How to use roughnesses **properly**
- [ ] Roughness implementation
- [ ] Sensitivity limits (e.g. if film is 99% hydrated you might not see it?)
- [ ] Resolution
- [ ] Perhaps discussion of differential evolution is not necessary
